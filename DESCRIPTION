Description: The recount2 project re-processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on
    over 70,000 human RNA-seq samples spanning a variety of tissues, cell types
    and disease conditions. Researchers can easily access these data via the
    recount Bioconductor package, and can quickly import gene, exon, exon-exon
    junction and base-pair coverage data for uniformly processed data from the
    SRA, GTEx and TCGA projects in R for analysis. This workshop will include an
    overview of the recount2 project as well as methods and tools that have been
    to improve it since 2017. The overview will be followed by a hands-on
    session where you will dive into recount and related packages along the
    lines of the recount workflow.
